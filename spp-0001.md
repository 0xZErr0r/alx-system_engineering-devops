## Description
This rule put the standards used for smilepay system's architecture & design in simple layman terms. Smilepay uses flowchart & C4 model as a standard for documenting and designing software architecture and uses database diagram, UI/UX diagram, dependency diagram & deployment diagram to have a more agile design. Architecture & Design includes concepts such as:

**Architecture**: <br />
- High level /Big picture/ <br />
- What are we builing? <br /> 
- Where are we put data & components? <br />
- Trade-offs <br />

**Design**: <br />
- How the software is implemented? <br />
- Design pattern <br />
- Component / module / code level <br />
- Classes, interfaces, functions, responsibilities
- UML Sequence Diagram

<br />

> ### FlowChart
A flowchart a generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes. In smilepay it can be used to describe the systems workflow step-by-step to solving a task. Its the first diagram we use when drawing the architecture of any system.

<br />

> ### C4 Model
C4 stands for context, containers, components, and code - is a set of hierarchical diagrams that you can use to describe the software architecture at different zoom levels, each useful for different audiences. It is like Google Maps for a system. In smilepay we avoid doing the 4th diagram in the c4 model, the code diagram. This diagram is a low level diagram that consumes resources from the whole architecture & design process.

#### Context Diagram
```
System Context diagram aka C4 model Level 1 provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope 
fits into the world around it. This is a high level diagram intended for everyone both technical & non-technical 
people, inside and outside of the software development team.
```

#### Container Diagram
```
Container diagram aka C4 model Level 2 zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks. Intended for technical people inside and outside of the software development team; including software architects, developers and operations/support staff.
```

#### Component Diagram
```
Component diagram aka C4 model Level 3 zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it. This intended for the internal software development team like Software architects and developers. Each components are one task/module that will be given to one developer at a time.
```

<br />

> ### Database Diagram
```
Database diagrams graphically show the structure of the database. Designing & drawing data model(ER diagram) for SQL database's and a tree structure diagram for NoSQL is critical when bringing a software design to reality as a team.
```

<br />

> ### UI/UX Design
```
This diagram deals with user interfaces and user experience. UI design focuses on products look and usability, where UX design focuses on the functionality of the product from a user's perspective. This diagram is critical when doing user interfaces.
```

<br />

> ### DevOps
#### Dependency Diagram
[sample picture of dependency diagram] <br />
```
This diagram shows the interdependency of different sub-systems. Drawing it using the above diagram example helps teams trace and be aware of dependencies during deployement, updates and even security. 
```

<br />

#### Deployment Diagram
```
Deployment Diagram is a type of diagram that specifies the infrustructure, physical hardware and devops software on which the software system will execute. The deployment diagram is key for devops to navigate the system thats on production. This diagram is built on top of the container diagram as a layer. It will be used for maintainance and designing infrustructure scaleability.

## Specification

## Security Concerns
Security should always be kept in mind during architecture & design process and during changes(updates) other than that security implications are not of concern.
