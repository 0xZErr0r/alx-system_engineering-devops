## Security Concerns
The rule for Storage & Sharing is important as its security concerns are high. Cybersecurity 101 for any system is to not reveal the blueprint of a system. As such the storage and sharing of system information should be taken with precaution and their should be a level of access restriction for each member of smilepay according to their responsibility.
