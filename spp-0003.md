### Coding Standard /Coding Convention/
Coding standards are collections of rules and guidelines that determine the programming style, procedures, and methods for a programming language. Without the coding conventions, every individual in a team will settle their coding styles. It will not be easy to maintain and debug the code in the near future. Here are some of the coding standards that Smilepay dev team will have to keep:

<br />

### Coding Style /Programming Style/


<br />

#### Naming Covention
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic â€” a system such as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations which assists in remembering something that is designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. This standard is all about the naming standard of variables in Smilepay's source code.

Here are the specific variable naming conventions and syntax that will be used by smilepay development team:

<br />

Pascal Case <br />
Is a programming naming convention where the first letter of each compound word in a variable is capitalized.
```
"SmilePay"
```

<br />

Camel Case <br />
Is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case.
```
"smilePay"
```

<br />

#### Comments
*Documentation comments* is an ordinary multiline comment that begins with /** (instead of the usual /*) and ends with */. A doc comment appears immediately before a class, interface, method, or field definition and contains documentation for that class, interface, method, or field. This is the mandatory comment that should be used on all the source code.

<br />

#### Indentation
In computer programming, an indentation style is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey program structure. In such languages, indentation is meaningful to the compiler or interpreter; it is more than only a clarity or style issue. This is a standard critical for code readability and an important standard for code maintenance.

<br />

#### Whitespace
In computer programming, whitespace is any character or series of characters that represent horizontal or vertical space in typography. ... For example, the common whitespace symbol U+0020 SPACE (also ASCII 32) represents a blank space punctuation character in text, used as a word divider in Western scripts. This is a standard critical for code readability and an important standard for code maintenance.

## Security Concerns
**Security Concern 1:** <br />
The only security concern for the naming standard used is semantical, not syntax wise. The development team should be careful of meanings of the words used for a variable name, as some words could give hint to the tech stacks used for the system. This are some of the initial types of hints used by cyber security engineers to identify vulernabilities in a system. And variable names should be meaningful names as other members of the tech team see them, they should easily make sense of them.
