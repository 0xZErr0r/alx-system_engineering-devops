## Description
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic â€” a system such as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations which assists in remembering something that is designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. This rule is all about the naming standard of variables that should be followed by the smilepay development team.
 

<br />

## Specification
Here are the specific variable naming conventions and syntax that will be used by smilepay development team:

<br />

### Pascal Case 
Pascal Case is a programming naming convention where the first letter of each compound word in a variable is capitalized.
```
"SmilePay"
```

### Camel Case
Camel case is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case.
```
"smilePay"
```

<br />

## Security Concerns
**Security Concern 1:** <br />
The only security concern for the naming standard used is semantical, not syntax wise. The development team should be careful of meanings of the words used for a variable name, as some words could give hint to the tech stacks used for the system. This are some of the initial types of hints used by cyber security engineers to identify vulernabilities in a system.
