## Description
Proof of identity must be set for a user to be authenticated into a system. In Smilepay there are two ways to do this:

- **USSD Authentication**: As the primary method of authentication, the system provides a code that has been sent to their phone via USSD as proof of their identity. USSD authentication has zero dependence on users action. Unlike SMS verification, the code sent through the USSD is directly fed to the system without users knowing a code has been sent.

- **SMS Authentication**: When the USSD authentication fails, the system uses the traditional SMS authentication where user provides a code that has been sent to their phone via SMS as proof of their identity.

Smilepay's log in process is similar to most instant messengers like Whatsapp & Telegram. Users only enter there _**phone number**_ to log in.

## Security Concerns
**Security Concern 1:** <br />
Smilepay's authentication security concerns are connected to SMS authentication type only. This is because phone numbers are exposed to different types of threats. For example, when authenticating into a system, an SMS is sent. If users don't fill the code sent fast, get authenticated & delete the SMS fast. The code could be seen by someone else and they could use it to control the system before the first user authenticates with it. Hence, as smilepay accounts are attached to the phone number, sim cards should be highly protected and users should not trust anyone with their sim cards.

**Security Concern 2:** <br />
There are many ways your phone number is exposed, and you might not be aware of how many ways your data is shared online. Here is scenario's that can get users phone number's exposed which in turn might put their smilepay account in danger: 

- User's phone numbers could be linked to their social media or another online account. They should check their settings on social media profiles to make sure personal information like phone numbers is made private.

- Users might have overshared their phone numbers. They may have entered their information for a free trial, contest, or another online form, which potentially opened them up to receiving unwanted calls. 

- Users accepted the terms and conditions without reading the entire Terms of Service. Users have to make sure to read the terms and conditions to see exactly where their information is being shared or ask someone who can. 

- Users provided their phone number for a product they purchased. They also may provide their phone number to retailers for loyalty points or discounts.

- User's phone number was part of a data breach, making them easily accessible to scammers. Companies involved in data breaches must disclose what information was exposed. If users are unsure if their information was included, users should call the company directly and inquire.
