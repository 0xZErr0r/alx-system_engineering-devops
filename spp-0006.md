<br /><br />

### 3. Agent Account  
```
Is an account for use by Smilepay agents. This agents account could be used by a person or an entity that distrubute/exchange 
the digital money issued by Smilepay & collect the hard cash. And there are 4 types of agents that will do this job on 
different levels:
            a. Super Agent /Distro/
            b. Master Agent
            c. Agents
              - Fixed Agent
              - Walker Agent
              - Driver Agent
            d. Balancer Agent
```
  #### Super Agent /Distro/
  ```
A partner business, most of the time a bank, which takes electronic money from Smilepay and then distributes it to different types 
of agents, who in turn sell it to users or distributes it directly to users. Super agents usually profit from other partnership 
deals, not distribution of Smilepay electronic money.
  ```  
  
  <br />

  #### Master Agent
  ```
Sometimes called an aggregator is a business that purchases e-money from Super agents and then resells it to agents, who in turn 
sell it to users. Unlike a superagent, masteragents are responsible for recruiting agents, training agents and distributing the 
electronic money in a way thats attractive for agents and profitable to them when distributing in bulk.
  ```
  
  <br />

  #### Agents
  ```
A person or business that is contracted to facilitate transactions for users. The most important of these are cash-in and cashout 
(i.e. loading value into the mobile money system, and then converting it back out again); in many instances, agents register new 
customers too. Agents usually earn commissions for performing these services. They also often provide front-line customer 
service—such as teaching new users how to initiate transactions on their phone. Typically, agents will conduct other kinds of 
business in addition to mobile money. The kinds of individuals or businesses that can serve as agents will sometimes be limited 
by regulation, but small-scale traders, microfinance institutions, chain stores, and bank branches serve as agents in some 
markets. There are some instances where users might directly recharge from superagents like banks and not agents. Here the 
different types of agents:

Fixed Agents: 
Are agents that are usually businesses or anything that have legal fixed location.

Walker Agents:
Are agents that are just people, anywhere and everywhere on the road walking, sitting or even running.

Driver Agents
Are agents that are usually ride hailing drivers but could also be anyone that drives a car.
  ```
  
  <br />

  #### Balancer Agent
  ```
As each agents give both service of recharge and withdraw, the number of recharge they give out in a certain time might become 
more than the number of withdraw they give. This could hinder the agents ability to give out more recharges. And this could be 
in the middle of the day. As most agents will be working as agents as a secondary thing to there first job, this agents will not 
be able to go out to banks and get more electronic money on their own. So to make sure such problems will not hinder 
availabilities of withdraw and recharge services found at each agents for our users, balancer agents are needed to give out 
this services to agents to keep liquidity in check. Scenarios for Balancer Agents are the following:

> When agents give more recharge service than withdrawal service, the agent will have more physical cash on them. 

> When agents give more withdrawal service than recharge service, the agent will have more electronic money on them.

The whole job of a balancer agent comes from the above 2 scenarios. One is where agents have excess physical cash & no electronic 
money, which will make them to not be able to give recharge service anymore. Second one is when agents have excess electronic 
money & no physical cash, which will make them to not be able to give withdraw service anymore. Balancer agents solve this 
scenerio by traveling using SmilePay company motorcycles between agents that have too much physical cash & too much electronic 
money. And trying to balance what each agent have so that service of recharge & withdraw given by agents will be available at 
all times. 

In other words, Balancer agents travel between agents to make sure each agent have liquidity. And each Balancer agent manages 
the cash and electronic-value liquidity requirements of a particular group of agents. Liquidity is the ability of an agent to 
meet customers’ demands to purchase (cash in, withdraw) or sell (cash out, recharge) e-money. The key metric used to measure 
the liquidity of an agent is the sum of their e-money and cash balances (also known as their float balance).

## Security Concerns
In Smilepay, running multiple accounts that target different types of users and with various limits has its security risks as such financial institutions are required to have concepts like KYC, AML & CFT nailed down. 

<br />

#### _KYC (Know Your Customer)_ 
Are a set of standards used within the investment and financial services industry to verify customers, their risk profiles, and financial profile and protect financial institutions against fraud, corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing. Simply put this are rules related to AML/CFT which require providers to carry out procedures to identify a customer. KYC are the basics in running a mobile money account and the KYC needed for Smilepay accounts are set by Nation Bank of Ethiopia(Central Bank). 

<br />

#### _AML/CFT (Anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism)_ 
Are a set of rules, typically issued by central banks, that attempt to prevent and detect the use of financial services for money laundering
or to finance terrorism. The global standard-setter for AML/CFT rules is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). 

<br />

#### **Fractional Banking on E-Money Float** 
In a mobile money system, the balance between the total amount of e-money (short for “electronic money,” a stored value held in the accounts of users, agents, and the provider of the mobile money service) issued in the system and the physical cash deposited put by smilepay in the bank or in a government security or both have to be in equilibrum. Typically, the total value of e-money is mirrored in (a) bank account(s), such that even if the provider of the mobile money service were to fail, users could recover 100% of the value stored in their accounts. It is both a security risk and a illegal for e-money to not have an equal backed value in physical cash. But as it is true for banks do not back all their deposits with cash equivalents. Mobile money could potential be allowed to do fractional banking as well to a point.
