1. Phone Number
2. Public Name
3. Private Name
4. Smile Id

<br />

### 1. Phone Number
In Smilepay, everything starts with a phone number as such it is the best way to identify a user & specific users personal accounts. Phone numbers are used by senders as recipient address for transactions with personal accounts. Users enter into Smilepay using there phone number and they create accounts that are attached to phone numbers.

<br />

### 2. Public Name /Smile Tag/
In Smilepay, public names (smile tags) of accounts are the names used by users publicly to refer to there accounts and are used by senders as a recipient address for all types of transactions. Here are the public names of Smilepay's multiple accounts:

(a) 'Personal accounts' have a public name called "Username", which they can create on their own. For username users can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores with a minimum length of 5 characters.
 
(b) Business accounts have a public name called "Trademark", which is the brand name of the business. 

(c) Agent accounts have a public name that is similar to there private name, which is the agents actual "Full Name" or it could be any other name like "agent 47". And when the agent is not a person, the public name of this agent could be the "Trademark" OR "the Name used on the Business License" of that entity.

<br />

### 3. Private Name
In Smilepay, private names of accounts are the names used by users on there official documentation that are also used for KYC of Smilepay's multiple accounts and is the only one of the account identifier types that is not used for transactions. Here are the private names of Smilepay's multiple accounts: 

(a) Personal accounts have a private name called "Full Name".

<br />

### 4. Smile ID
In Smilepay a user can have multiple accounts, as such sending money using the users phone number as the only recipient address becomes impossible. As the system will not know to which account of the user the money is being sent to. Plus, its not ideal for public figures to share their phone numbers while asking for donations using Smilepay. Smile ID's are used by senders as a recipient address for all types of transactions.

Smile ID is a solution that is 7 digital and above, number based Smilepay account address that solves the above two problems. There are three types of Smile ID's based on the first initial digit:

(a) When a smile id starts with the digit "1", it is a personal account smile id

(b) When a smile id starts with the digit "2", it is a business account smile id

(c) When a smile id starts with the digit "3", it is a agent account smile id

<br />

Here are the starting Smile ID's for each Smilepay multiple accounts:
```
Personal Smile Id:    1-000-000
Business Smile Id:    2-000-000
Agent Smile Id:       3-000-000

## Security Concerns
**Security Concern 1:** <br /> 
As business smile ID grows from the start as it is assigned to more and more users, it will reach to a stage where the business Smile ID and Phone Number's will look similar. This concern comes into question as the conditions that should be fullfilled for this problem to manifest are that the assumption there will be around 200 billion business accounts created in Smilepay.


```
2-000-000             --> "Business Smile ID" starting digit
     .
     .
     .     
2-000-000-000-00      --> "Business Smile ID" as it reach's 200 billion business account
     .
     .
     .     
2-519*-***-***-**     --> Business Smile ID as it approach's similar digits that look like a phone number



2-519-113-677-27      --> Phone Number
```

<br />

**Security Concern 2:** <br />
Its not ideal for public figures to share their phone numbers while asking for donations using Smilepay. As phone numbers can be used to harasse this public figures and even make this people more vulnerable to social engineering. Smile ID solves this risk for this types of people.
