## Security Concerns
**Security Concern 1:** <br />
The biggest security concern for this rule is the issuer. Access to the issuer should be kept at the highest security of the business. As attackers can create un-backed currency using the issuer while its stored on the funder. And they could use it for there gain or withdraw it. Even though the attacker can be identified by the KYC on the system, this is a major security concern.
