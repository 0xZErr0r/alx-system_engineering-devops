## Description
This rule is all about the pay-out(reward) & pay-in(quota) Smilepay as a system does while users are transacting in it. Here are the three scenerio's that determine when:

a. Smilepay gets money **Quota** when users transact amongst themselves. 
<br />
b. Smilepay gets nothing when the users sender account is also registred under **Exception Quota**.
<br />
c. Smilpay pays out money **Reward** when users with agent accounts recharge other users. 
<br />

<br />

### Quota
Is a fixed share of the transactions that happen in Smilepay between multiple accounts. This shares are cut using two ways based on the account type of the sender & recipient accounts. Here are the Quota types:

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; a. **Quota from Sender (Qs):** <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Is quota cut from the sender accounts balance.

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; b. **Quota from Transaction (Qt):** <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Is quota cut from the transaction being sent.

<br />

### Exception Quota
Are specific few accounts that are temporarily (or in special case permanently) exempted from paying quota while sending money to any other account. Exception quota's are implemented to users who are either catagorized in the following two groups:
 
 - Impacted Communities 
 - Heroic Communities

<br />

Impacted Communities
```
Are commnuities affected by man-made or natural disasters that affects the communities economical, social & economical fabric. Here are examples of some of the disasters that affect this types of communities:

 - War zones
 - Famines, natural or man-made 
 - Pestilence, disease's that grow to become epidemics or even pandemics
 - Natural Disasters (Drought, Floods, Wildfires, Rainstorm, Dust Storms, Earthquakes, Volcanic Eruptions)
```

<br />

Heroic Communities
```
Are communities that are not appreciated and are those who do the most important work in the general community. This are professions that deal with the survival of communities. And here are some of them:

- SSF (Small-Scale Farmers) Community 
  [Agriculture Sector]

- Nurses & Doctors Community 
  [Health Sector]

- Teachers & Public Schools Community 
  [Education Sector]

- Soldiers & Police Community
  [Security Sector]

- Volunteers Community 
  [NGO / Nonprofit Sector / Non-Governmental Organization Sector]  


Note:
VOLUNTEERS COMMUNITY is the community that runs organization's focused on helping the lives of the elderly, those with mental disabilities, women & children by providing all basic services (food, clothes, shelter, hygiene facilities, medical, educational and others) to the residents in the center.
```

<br />

### Reward
As Agents (the normal base Agents that include Fixed Agents, Walker Agents & Driver Agents), their main job is recharge and withdraw, but for this jobs to be executed well incentives/payments/ are needed for the agents. This incentive is called "Reward". Reward is an automatic incentive payments that is given to the users everytime they recharge users account. The reward system is quite lucrative for agents but its vulernable to "Transaction Simulation" attack (i.e. there is more on SPP-0015).

<br />

## Security Concerns
