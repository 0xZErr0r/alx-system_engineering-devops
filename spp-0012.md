### Push Notification

Smilepay can only send a push notification if the user has the app installed and when they are they are sent at any time. Push notifications can be sent without the Smilepay app requiring the user’s contact information (note that the app must first ask the user for permission in order to send push notifications). There are two kinds of contents Smilepay app qualifies for a push notification service:
 - Smilepay Updates <br /> 
  (notifying users about successful transactions, business updates, app updates, discounts ...)
 - New Miniapps/Services <br />
  (notifying users about the new miniapp services available)
