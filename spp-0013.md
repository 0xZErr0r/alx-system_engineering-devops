## Description
In Smilepay, Block (blocking) is putting the whole Smilepay account or certain features on hold as penality for breaking Smilepay rules, terms & conditions. That means users have nothing or less to use on the app until the block clears. There are three main types of blocks for any user in smilepay: <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; a. User Block <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; b. Account Block <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; c. Currency Block <br />

<br />

a. **User Block** <br />
Is a block type that bans Smilepay users from using the app completely, it basically bans all the multiple accounts of the user at once. User block is probably used on users that have broken the highest rules of Smilepay.

<br />

b. **Account Block** <br />
Is a block type that bans Smilepay users from using one of there multiple accounts, it basically bans one multiple account of a Smilepay user at time. 

<br />

c. **Currency Block** <br />
The Smilepay system is designed & developed to be able to host multiple currencies. As such in the future users could potentially use different different currencies with there current accounts. Currency block is a block type that bans Smilepay users from using one of the multiple currencies in the system, it basically bans the use of a certain currency for a user at a time.

<br />

### Ban Type 
Is the ban duration used by Smilepay blocking system. Ban type is a specification of for how long a user is banned, is it for a specific time or indefinitly. Here are the list of ban types that could happen in Smilepay:
- Hourly Ban
- Daily Ban
- Montly Ban
- Yearly Ban
- Forever Ban
- Custom Ban (could be for any amount of time interval)

<br />

### Block History
Is a feature that is not accessible to Smilepay users, but is a feature for tracking bad behaviours of users. As the block history of users show Smilepay historical behaviour of users, it helps Smilepay decide what kind of block penality should be applied to a new offender user by looking at their block history, if they have one.

## Security Concerns
**Security Concern 1:** <br />
Smilepay's block system should be protected with the best security with logs that save all the activities. As attackers could try to unblock or decrease there ban duration without serving there full penality.
