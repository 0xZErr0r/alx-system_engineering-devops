## Description
Ongoing payments are floating payments that need certain conditions to be met before becoming successul payments. Here are the three types of ongoing payments in Smilepay: <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; a. Payme Anytime Pay <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; b. Guaranty Pay <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; c. Escrow Pay <br />

<br />

### a. Payme Anytime Pay
Is an ongoing payment type that acts like a loan to a best friend which can be used multiple times. This payment is basically send with a notification to payback. Users use this payment type when they want to loan a close friend money. Users enter there friends account & the amount they want to loan and touch the button "payme anytime". The money is transfered to the friend like a normal send. But on the friend's Smilepay app, under the ongoing payment there will be an active paying back method with notification to remind the friend to pay back anytime.

<br />

### b. Guaranty Pay
Is an ongoing payment type that acts like a loan which can only be used one-time to pay for whatever before using it again. Guaranty pay is used when users don't have enough balance to pay for a product or a service & is an ideal payment type for sellers or recipients to accept as the money transfer is guarantied. This is because once users guranty pay & commit there account to another account, Smilepay pays the amount gurantied to the sellers or recipients. The next time they recharge the amount they commited will be automatically cut before the recharge/receieved amount hit there balance as Smilepay has to recoup what it payed for the user.

<br />

### c. Escrow Pay
Is an ongoing payment type that reduces transaction risk for online buyers where the money sent from buyers is kept in the custody of a third party and takes effect only when the specific condition have been fulfilled like shoppers verifying whether they are happy with the goods they have purchased before releasing funds to the seller. 

The main problem escrow pay solves in an online transaction is trust. Buyers don't trust the sellers & sellers don't trust the buyers. As such Smilepay built an escrow service were buyers transfer the money to Smilepay's Escrow system. Then Smilepay informs the sellers it has received the money and instructs sellers to send the products. The buyers see the products, if they are happy Smilepay transfers the escrow money to the sellers. If the buyers are not happy Smilepay returns the money & make sure's the return of the products to the seller.

## Security Concerns
Security Concern 1: <br />
A security concern on guaranty pay is that users might try to just sign up & verify for Smilepay account just to take advantage of the guaranty pay feature to pay for something using it & completely avoid the Smilepay app after.

<br />

Security Concern 2: <br />
A low security concern on escrow pay is that the escrow pay process should be legally backed. As scenerio's were sellers products are returned, the products might not be returned in the condition they were in. Smilepay has to have the legal & operational solutions for this process not to be a hinderance to the escrow system.
