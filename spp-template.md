## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and
layman-accessible explanation of the SPP.

## Dependencies
Should clearly list the dependencies this SPP has on other SPPs. May go into further
discussion about the circumstances of the dependency, although a list is sufficient.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Security Concerns
All SPPs should carefully consider areas where security may be a concern, and document them
accordingly. If a change does not have security implications, write "N/A".
