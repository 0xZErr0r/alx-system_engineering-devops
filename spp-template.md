## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and
layman-accessible explanation of the SPP.

## Dependencies
Should clearly list the dependencies this SPP has on other SPPs. May go into further
discussion about the circumstances of the dependency, although a list is sufficient.

## Motivation
Should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem
that the SPP solves. SPP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Design Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated this particular design and
why certain design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were
considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other protocols. The rationale
may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important
objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Security Concerns
All SPPs should carefully consider areas where security may be a concern, and document them
accordingly. If a change does not have security implications, write "N/A".
